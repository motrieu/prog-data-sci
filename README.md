# How to run
Before you run the code, it can be beneficial to have set up a virtual environment. 

EXPLAIN HOW? 

After you have activated your virtual environment, you can start running the code. Navigate into the directory and execute each script seperately. 

 - To scrape top 250 movies: run movie_scraper.py through your IDE or using: python movie_scraper.py in the terminal

 - To scrape top 100 celebs: run celeb_scraper.py through your IDE or using: python celeb_scraper.py in the terminal

 - To scrape reviews of "Home Alone": run ha_scraper.py through your IDE or using: python ha_scraper.py in the terminal

The csv files will show up in the root folder.
