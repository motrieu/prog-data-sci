# Coding Rules and VS Code Tips
## Documentation Guidelines
Every module, class, function, etc. should have a docstring where sensible (e.g. not for obvious setter, getter functions)
Docstring format is the **Google** style: https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings
Use autogen tools for docstring creation where possible (e.g. autoDocstring).
## Cooperation Guidelines
The main branch is locked, meaning nobody can push changes directly to the main branch. This is done so no unreviewed code can break the stable code base.
In order to change the code:
1. Branch of the main branch. You can either
    - Create an indiviual branch for each task (e.g. mtr_working_scrape-class)
    - Create one working branch which you will sync with the main branch on a regular bases (e.g mtr_working)
2. Create your changes in your local repo, commit and push your working branch to the remote repo (GitHub)
3. Once your remote branch has been pushed, you can create a merge request on GitHub. Detail your changes and create MR.
Currently the MR has to be approved by at least one person and the code owner (@Moritz). The last step is only to make sure everything is ok in the beginning and is subject to change later so you can merge w/o me. 
Once your MR is requested, ping the group to request a code review. Everybody that wants to can clone your working branch and leave commments on the MR. If any changes have to be made, make them on your local working branch and push them to remote, they will automaticially be included in your MR. Once approved my enough people (or code owner), you can merge the branch to main, where you potentially have to resolve merge conflicts,
4. Once merged don't forget to either create a new working branch or sync your current one (see 1.)
